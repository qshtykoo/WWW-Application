			Early reviews were overwhelmingly positive. Todd Brown, founder and editor of Twitch Film, 
			gave a highly positive review of the film, saying that "a tale that weds absolutely gorgeous artwork with beautifully nuanced characters 
			and a deep but natural rooting in ancient folk tales and magic, Song of the Sea has an assured and timeless quality to it. 
			It is the sort of story that feels as though it always existed somewhere, just waiting until now to be told". 
			"Song of the Sea is not about selling units, it's about story and heart and emotion and wonder and craftsmanship 
			and because of that it becomes timeless, a beautiful piece of art that will delight audiences old and young 
			and confirms what many suspected of Moore after Kells: The man's a master storyteller, and we can only hope he has many, 
			many more stories to tell."

			Conor, a lighthouse keeper, lives on an island with son Ben, his pregnant wife Bronagh, and sheepdog Cú. Bronagh disappears late one night, 
			presumably dying after childbirth, leaving behind daughter Saoirse. Six years later, Conor is broken, Saoirse is mute, and Ben is antagonistic 
			towards Saoirse, blaming her for Bronagh's disappearance. On Saoirse's birthday, they are visited by their grandmother, "Granny". That night, 
			Ben scares Saoirse with a story of Mac Lir and his mother Macha, the Owl Witch, who stole his feelings and turned him to stone. 
			Later, Saoirse plays a seashell horn given to Ben by their mother, leading her to a white sealskin coat in Conor's closet.
